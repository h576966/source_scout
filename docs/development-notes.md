# Development Notes

Useful implementation notes for the current Source Scout product path.

## FastMCP

- Define tools with `@mcp.tool()` and use `annotations={"readOnlyHint": True}`
  only for tools that do not write files, mutate the catalog, or record outcomes.
- Prefer `Annotated[..., Field(...)]` for tool parameters so MCP clients get clear
  schemas.
- Return project dataclasses from `models.py` for structured tool output.
- Use `ToolError` for user-correctable validation errors.
- Use structured runtime errors for recoverable system failures such as rate
  limits.

## GitHub API

- Repository search uses `GET /search/repositories` with query qualifiers such as
  `language:`, `topic:`, `pushed:`, `archived:false`, `is:public`, `size:`, and
  `in:name,description,topics,readme`.
- Qualification rejects archived, private, stale, mirrored, oversized,
  docs-only/empty, lockfile-only, and generated/vendor-heavy repositories.
- Authenticated search has tighter search-specific limits than normal REST calls;
  keep scouting offline/batched rather than per MCP request.
- Treat GitHub language metadata as a signal only. Confirm stack via manifests,
  config files, and local source snapshots.
- Resolve and store the exact default-branch commit SHA before analysis.

## Local Snapshots

- Clone or fetch by commit SHA, not moving branch names.
- Never execute code from cloned repositories.
- Store generated catalog data under `.source_scout/`.
- Garbage-collect old snapshots through `source-scout gc`.

## Model Runtime

- LM Studio is the intended local OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- Default endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1`.
- Source Scout sends model requests through the OpenAI Python SDK using LM
  Studio's `/v1/responses` compatibility endpoint.
- Windows CLI: `C:\Users\Nikla\.lmstudio\bin\lms.exe`.
- Gemma is for JSON profiling/synthesis after deterministic evidence exists.
- FastContext is for evidence refinement over read-only `READ`, `GLOB`, and
  `GREP`-style tools, not general code generation.
- Standalone FastContext exploration is evaluated through
  `evals/golden/local_explore_source_scout_v1.json` and
  `source-scout eval-local-explore --suite source-scout --max-turns 7`.
- Final FastContext evidence is budgeted to at most three citations across at
  most three files, with one or two tight ranges preferred.

## Prompt Maintenance

- Keep production prompts in source code and review them like application logic.
- Bump the relevant `PROMPT_VERSION` whenever prompt behavior changes.
- Prefer short, outcome-first prompts with explicit evidence rules, retrieval
  budgets, validation rules, and output schema expectations.
- For tool-heavy Responses flows, preserve prior assistant output items before
  appending function-call outputs.
- Do not add broad process instructions unless tests or evals show they improve
  retrieval or assessment quality.

Local status and smoke tests:

```powershell
lms ls
lms server status
lms server start
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1/models
source-scout lmstudio-status --smoke-test
```

Default test runs focus on the current catalog, assessment, LM Studio, and
FastContext paths:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q
```

Current local model defaults:

```text
SOURCE_SCOUT_GEMMA_MODEL=google/gemma-4-12b-qat
SOURCE_SCOUT_FASTCONTEXT_MODEL=fastcontext-1.0-4b-rl
```
